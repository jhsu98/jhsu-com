I wore a lot of hats during my time at Zerion, but none was more energizing than that of the solutions consultant. Building relationships with customers and earning their trust was great for revenue, but on an individual level where it really shone through was the shoulder-to-shoulder working relationship solving complex business challenges. Whether it was an agriculture company whose livelihood hinges on bets placed two years in advance regarding what to plant and where to plant it or a utilities company who needs to track the progress of smart grid installation, being able to not only advocate for, but architect and in many cases implementing tailor-made solutions was the most rewarding part of the job.

I enjoyed this so much that I've decided to continue doing it. Thirtysix Solutions will be my professional face moving forward. I'm eager to continue leveraging my expertise in data collection, business process automation, and integrations one business problem at a time.

So, if you need help architecting, developing, or evolving your digital data processes, head on over to [https://thirtysix.solutions](https://thirtysix.solutions) and drop me an email.
